-   :material-download:{ .lg .middle } __Gather__

    ---

    Gather feedback from all available internal & external sources:

    - Feedback form
    - QA recommendations
    - self-reflection after training
    - GitHub issues or Fork and pull requests
    - Survey
    - Direct mail contact
    - Other means of communication


-   :material-google-analytics:{ .lg .middle } __Analyse__

    ---

    Analyse the gathered information in a structured way.

    Create a list of potential improvements with impact level (high, moderate, low)


-   :material-arrow-up-bold-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Improve__

    ---

    Select items from the list that will be part of a new version.

    Choose items that make sense to be in the same new release.



-   :material-repeat:{ .lg .middle } __Repeat__

    ---

    Start a new cycle of the FAIR-by-Design methodology that will implement the selected items.

    After the Verify stage, you will reenter continuous improvement with newly gathered information....
