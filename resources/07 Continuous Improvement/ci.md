# Stage 7 - Continuos Integration 

!!! quote ""

    To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often. - *Winston Churchill*

    -   :material-download:{ .lg .middle } __Gather__

        ---

        Gather feedback from all available internal & external sources.

        ??? note "Potential sources"

            - Feedback form </br>
            - QA recommendations </br>
            - self-reflection after training </br>
            - Survey </br>
            - Direct mail contact </br>
            - Other means of communication </br>


    -   :material-google-analytics:{ .lg .middle } __Analyse__

        ---

        Analyse the gathered information in a structured way.

        Create a list of potential improvements with impact level (high, moderate, low)


    -   :material-arrow-up-bold-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Improve__

        ---

        Select items from the list that will be part of a new version.

        Choose items that make sense to be in the same new release.



    -   :material-repeat:{ .lg .middle } __Repeat__

        ---

        Start a new cycle of the FAIR-by-Design methodology that will implement the selected items.

        After the Verify stage, you will reenter continuous improvement with newly gathered information....
