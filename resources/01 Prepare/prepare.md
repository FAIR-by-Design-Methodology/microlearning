??? success "Accessible"

    The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.

??? warning "Interoperable"

    The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.

    Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.

??? danger "Reusable"

    The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.
