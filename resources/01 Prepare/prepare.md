# Stage 1 - Prepare

!!! quote ""

    Before anything else, preparation is the key to success! -- **Alexander Graham Bell​**

## First things first. What is FAIR?

??? note "Findable"

    The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.

??? success "Accessible"

    The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.

??? warning "Interoperable"

    The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.

    Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.

??? danger "Reusable"

    The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.

## Adopt a metadata schema

## Define

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-flag-checkered:{ .lg .middle } __Purpose__

    ---

    When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes?

-   :material-target-account:{ .lg .middle } __Target Audience__

    ---

    Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context?

-   :material-history:{ .lg .middle } __Prerequisites__

    ---

    What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process?


-   :material-target-account:{ .lg .middle } __Scope__

    ---

    Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course?

-   :material-bullseye-arrow:{ .lg .middle } __Learning Objectives__

    ---

    What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process?

    ??? info "Be SMART"

        Objectives should be specific, ​measurable, ​attainable, ​relevant and ​time-bound​.

    ??? hint "Use Blooms Taxonomy"
    
        Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability.
