    - *Accessible* : human and machine readable metadata and object stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures
    - *Interoperable*: the metadata follows a commonly accepted metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies and formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used
    - *Reusable*: has a clear usage license and accurate information on provenance
