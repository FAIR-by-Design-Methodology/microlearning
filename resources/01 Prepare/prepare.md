# Stage 1 - Prepare

!!! quote ""

    Before anything else, preparation is the key to success! -- **Alexander Graham Bell​**

## First things first. What is FAIR?

??? note "Findable"

    The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.

??? success "Accessible"

    The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.

??? warning "Interoperable"

    The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.

    Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.

??? danger "Reusable"

    The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.

## Define

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-flag-checkered:{ .lg .middle } __Purpose__

    ---

   When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes?

-   :material-target-account:{ .lg .middle } __Target Audience__

    ---

    Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context?

-   :material-history:{ .lg .middle } __Prerequisites__

    ---

    What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process?

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Customization](https://google.com)

-   :material-target-account:{ .lg .middle } __Scope__

    ---

    Is it going to be a single learning object, or an aggregation of some sort such as a course?

-   :material-bullseye-arrow:{ .lg .middle } __Learning Objectives__

    ---

    What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process?

    ??? info "Be SMART"

        Objectives should be specific, ​measurable, ​attainable, ​relevant and ​time-bound​.

    ??? hint "Use Blooms Taxonomy"
    
        Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: See more](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects_cont/#defining-learning-objectives)

Have SMART objectives! ​

specific, ​

measurable, ​

attainable, ​

relevant and ​

time-bound​



Look for the Blooms taxonomy verbs!​
